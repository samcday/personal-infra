/**
 * Provides a Hetzner Cloud Network Route to represent a Network route in the Hetzner Cloud.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as hcloud from "@pulumi/hcloud";
 *
 * const mynet = new hcloud.Network("mynet", {ipRange: "10.0.0.0/8"});
 * const privNet = new hcloud.NetworkRoute("privNet", {
 *     networkId: mynet.id,
 *     destination: "10.100.1.0/24",
 *     gateway: "10.0.1.1",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Network Route entries can be imported using a compound ID with the following format`<network-id>-<destination>`
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import hcloud:index/networkRoute:NetworkRoute myroute 123-10.0.0.0/16
 * ```
